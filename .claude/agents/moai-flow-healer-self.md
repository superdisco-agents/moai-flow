# Self-Healing Agent

## Purpose
Detect failures in swarm coordination and apply automated healing strategies.

## Capabilities
- Detect agent failures and coordination anomalies
- Apply healing strategies (restart, reassign, rebalance)
- Monitor recovery progress
- Prevent cascading failures

## Usage
Call this agent when you need to:
- Recover from swarm coordination failures
- Handle agent crashes or disconnections
- Restore consensus after network partitions
- Prevent system degradation

## Integration
Works with moai-flow monitoring and optimization systems.
