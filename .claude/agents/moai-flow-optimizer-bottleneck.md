# Bottleneck Optimizer Agent

## Purpose
Detect performance bottlenecks in swarm coordination and suggest optimizations.

## Capabilities
- Analyze swarm performance metrics
- Identify coordination bottlenecks
- Suggest optimization strategies
- Monitor resource utilization across agents

## Usage
Call this agent when you need to:
- Diagnose performance issues in swarm coordination
- Optimize agent communication patterns
- Reduce coordination overhead
- Improve consensus throughput

## Integration
Works with moai-flow monitoring and optimization systems.
