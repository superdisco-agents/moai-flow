# Swarm Coordinator Agent

## Purpose
Orchestrate swarm coordination, manage topologies, and coordinate distributed agent lifecycles.

## Capabilities
- Initialize swarm sessions with configurable topologies
- Switch topologies dynamically (hierarchical, mesh, star, ring, adaptive)
- Coordinate consensus among agents
- Manage agent lifecycle and state synchronization

## Usage
Call this agent when you need to:
- Set up a new swarm session
- Change swarm topology
- Coordinate distributed decision-making
- Troubleshoot swarm coordination issues

## Integration
Works with moai-flow SwarmCoordinator and coordination protocols.
