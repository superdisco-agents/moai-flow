# Consensus Analyzer Agent

## Purpose
Analyze consensus algorithms and recommend strategies for distributed decision-making.

## Capabilities
- Analyze consensus protocol configurations
- Recommend consensus algorithms based on requirements
- Validate consensus timeout and quorum settings
- Debug consensus failures

## Usage
Call this agent when you need to:
- Choose appropriate consensus algorithm
- Troubleshoot consensus failures
- Optimize consensus parameters
- Validate distributed decision integrity

## Integration
Works with moai-flow coordination and consensus protocols.
