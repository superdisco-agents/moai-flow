# ⚒️ MoAI-ADK Step 2: Execute Implementation (Run) - TDD Implementation

> **Architecture**: Commands → Agents → Skills. This command orchestrates ONLY through `Task()` tool.
>
> **Delegation Model**: Phase-based sequential agent delegation. Command orchestrates 4 phases directly.

**Workflow**: Phase 1 → Analysis & Planning → Phase 2 → TDD Implementation → Phase 3 → Git Operations → Phase 4 → Completion & Guidance.

---

## 🎯 Command Purpose

Execute TDD implementation of SPEC requirements through complete agent delegation.

The `/moai:2-run` command orchestrates the complete implementation workflow:

1. **Phase 1**: SPEC analysis and execution plan creation
2. **Phase 2**: TDD implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
3. **Phase 3**: Git commit management
4. **Phase 4**: Completion and next steps guidance

**Run on**: `$ARGUMENTS` (SPEC ID, e.g., SPEC-001)

---

## 💡 Execution Philosophy: "Plan → Run → Sync"

`/moai:2-run` performs SPEC implementation through phase-based sequential agent delegation:

```
User Command: /moai:2-run SPEC-001
    ↓
Phase 1: Task(subagent_type="manager-strategy")
    → SPEC Analysis & Execution Plan Creation
    ↓
Phase 2: Task(subagent_type="manager-tdd")
    → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR TDD Cycle
    ↓
Phase 2.5: Task(subagent_type="manager-quality")
    → TRUST 5 Quality Validation
    ↓
Phase 3: Task(subagent_type="manager-git")
    → Commit Creation & Git Operations
    ↓
Phase 4: AskUserQuestion(...)
    → Completion Summary & Next Steps Guidance
    ↓
Output: Implemented feature with passing tests and commits
```

### Key Principle: Zero Direct Tool Usage

**This command uses ONLY these tools:**

- ✅ **Task()** for phase agent delegation (manager-strategy → manager-tdd → manager-quality → manager-git)
- ✅ **AskUserQuestion()** for user approval and next steps
- ✅ **TodoWrite()** for task tracking
- ❌ No Read/Write/Edit/Bash (all delegated to agents)

Command orchestrates phases sequentially; agents handle complexity.

## 🚀 Phase Execution Details

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

Command calls `Task(subagent_type="manager-strategy")`:

1. Agent reads SPEC document
2. Analyzes requirements and creates execution strategy
3. Returns plan for user approval
4. Waits for user confirmation (proceed/modify/postpone)
5. Stores plan context for Phase 2

### Phase 2: TDD Implementation

Command calls `Task(subagent_type="manager-tdd")`:

1. Agent initializes task tracking (TodoWrite)
2. Checks domain readiness (if multi-domain SPEC)
3. Executes RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle
4. Returns implementation results and coverage metrics

### Phase 2.5: Quality Validation

Command calls `Task(subagent_type="manager-quality")`:

1. Agent verifies TRUST 5 principles (Test-first, Readable, Unified, Secured, Trackable)
2. Validates test coverage (>= 85%)
3. Checks security compliance
4. Returns quality assessment (PASS/WARNING/CRITICAL)

### Phase 3: Git Operations

Command calls `Task(subagent_type="manager-git")`:

1. Agent creates feature branch if needed
2. Creates commits with implementation changes
3. Verifies commits were successful
4. Returns commit summary

### Phase 4: Completion & Guidance

Command calls `AskUserQuestion()`:

1. Displays implementation summary
2. Shows next action options
3. Guides user to `/moai:3-sync` or additional features

---

## 📋 Execution Flow (High-Level)

```
/moai:2-run SPEC-XXX
    ↓
Parse SPEC ID from $ARGUMENTS
    ↓
✅ Phase 1: Task(subagent_type="manager-strategy")
    → Analyze SPEC → Create execution plan → Get approval
    ↓
✅ Phase 2: Task(subagent_type="manager-tdd")
    → RED-GREEN-REFACTOR → Tests passing → Coverage verified
    ↓
✅ Phase 2.5: Task(subagent_type="manager-quality")
    → Validate TRUST 5 principles → Return quality status
    ↓
✅ Phase 3: Task(subagent_type="manager-git")
    → Create feature branch → Commit changes → Verify commits
    ↓
✅ Phase 4: AskUserQuestion(...)
    → Display summary → Guide next steps → Offer options
    ↓
Output: "Implementation complete. Next step: /moai:3-sync"
```

## 🎯 Command Implementation

### Sequential Phase Execution with Resume Chain

**Command implementation flow (with Resume for context continuity):**

```
# Phase 1: SPEC Analysis & Planning
plan_result = Task(
  subagent_type="manager-strategy",
  description="Analyze SPEC-$ARGUMENTS and create execution plan",
  prompt="""
SPEC ID: $ARGUMENTS

Analyze this SPEC and create detailed execution plan:
1. Extract requirements and success criteria
2. Identify implementation phases and tasks
3. Determine tech stack and dependencies
4. Estimate complexity and effort
5. Create step-by-step execution strategy
6. Present plan for user approval
"""
)

# Store agent ID for resume chain
$PLANNER_AGENT_ID = plan_result.metadata.agent_id

# Log Phase 1 checkpoint
Log to .moai/logs/phase-checkpoints.json:
  phase: 1
  agent_id: $PLANNER_AGENT_ID
  status: "PLANNING_COMPLETE"
  timestamp: NOW()

# User approval checkpoint
approval = AskUserQuestion({
    "question": "Does this execution plan look good?",
    "header": "Plan Review",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
        {"label": "Proceed with plan", "description": "Start implementation"},
        {"label": "Modify plan", "description": "Request changes"},
        {"label": "Postpone", "description": "Stop here, continue later"}
    ]
})

# Phase 2: TDD Implementation (Resume from Phase 1)
if approval == "Proceed with plan":
    implementation_result = Task(
        subagent_type="manager-tdd",
        resume="$PLANNER_AGENT_ID",  # ⭐ Resume: Inherit planning context
        description="Implement SPEC-$ARGUMENTS using TDD cycle",
        prompt="""
SPEC ID: $ARGUMENTS

You are the manager-tdd agent. You are continuing from the implementation plan created in Phase 1.

The full planning context (analysis, decisions, architecture) is inherited from previous phase via resume.
Use this context to proceed directly to implementation without re-analyzing requirements.

Execute complete TDD implementation:
1. Write failing tests (RED phase)
2. Implement minimal code (GREEN phase)
3. Refactor for quality (REFACTOR phase)
4. Ensure test coverage >= 85%
5. Verify all tests passing
6. Return implementation summary

        description="Validate TRUST 5 compliance for SPEC-$ARGUMENTS",
        prompt="""
SPEC ID: $ARGUMENTS

You are the manager-quality agent. You are continuing from the implementation context.

The full context (planning, implementation results) is inherited from previous phases via resume.
This ensures quality validation has complete architectural and implementation context.

Validate implementation against TRUST 5 principles:
- T: Test-first (tests exist and pass)
- R: Readable (code is clear and documented)
- U: Unified (follows project patterns)
- S: Secured (no security vulnerabilities)
- T: Trackable (changes are logged and traceable)

Return quality assessment with specific findings.

SPEC ID: $ARGUMENTS

You are the manager-git agent. You are continuing from the full implementation context.

The complete context (planning, implementation, quality review) is inherited via resume.
This context enables creation of meaningful commit messages with full understanding of feature scope and design decisions.

Create git commits for implementation:
1. Create feature branch: feature/SPEC-$ARGUMENTS
2. Stage all relevant files
3. Create meaningful commits (follow conventional commits, use context for descriptions)
4. Verify commits created successfully
5. Return commit summary with SHA references

### Resume Chain Summary

**Context Flow (with Resume):**

```
Phase 1: SPEC Analysis
  → Agent ID: abc123

Phase 2: Task(resume="abc123")
  → Inherits: Full planning context
  → Implements: Without re-reading SPEC or re-analyzing

Phase 2.5: Task(resume="abc123")
  → Inherits: Planning + Implementation context
  → Validates: With complete feature knowledge

Phase 3: Task(resume="abc123")
  → Inherits: Complete feature context
  → Creates: Commits with full context understanding
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **99K Token Savings**: No re-transmission of context between phases
- ✅ **Context Continuity**: Full knowledge chain across all phases
- ✅ **Unified Coding**: Phase 1 architectural decisions naturally propagate
- ✅ **Better Commits**: manager-git understands full context for meaningful messages

## Final Step: Next Action Selection

After TDD implementation completes, use AskUserQuestion tool to guide user to next action:

```python
AskUserQuestion({
    "questions": [{
        "question": "Implementation is complete. What would you like to do next?",
        "header": "Next Steps",
        "multiSelect": false,
        "options": [
            {
                "label": "Sync Documentation",
                "description": "Execute /moai:3-sync to organize documentation and create PR"
            },
            {
                "label": "Additional Implementation",
                "description": "Implement more features"
            },
            {
                "label": "Quality Verification",
                "description": "Review tests and code quality"
            }
        ]
    }]
})
```

**Important**:

- Use conversation language from config
- No emojis in any AskUserQuestion fields
- Always provide clear next step options

## ⚡️ EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

**You must NOW execute the command following the "Execution Philosophy" described above.**

1. Start Phase 1: Analysis & Planning immediately.
2. Call the `Task` tool with `subagent_type="manager-strategy"`.
3. Do NOT just describe what you will do. DO IT.
