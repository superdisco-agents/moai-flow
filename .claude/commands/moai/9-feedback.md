# 🗣️ MoAI-ADK Step 9: Feedback Loop

> **Architecture**: Commands → Agents → Skills. This command orchestrates ONLY through `Task()` tool.
> **Delegation Model**: Feedback collection delegated to `manager-quality` agent.

**Workflow Integration**: This command implements the feedback loop of the MoAI workflow, allowing users to report issues or suggestions directly from the CLI.

---

## 🎯 Command Purpose

Collect user feedback, bug reports, or feature suggestions and create GitHub issues automatically.

**Run on**: `$ARGUMENTS` (Feedback type)

---

## 💡 Execution Philosophy

`/moai:9-feedback` performs feedback collection through agent delegation:

```
User Command: /moai:9-feedback [type]
    ↓
Phase 1: Task(subagent_type="manager-quality")
    → Analyze feedback type
    → Collect details via AskUserQuestion
    → Create GitHub Issue via Skill
    ↓
Output: Issue created with link
```

### Key Principle: Zero Direct Tool Usage

**This command uses ONLY these tools:**

- ✅ **Task()** for agent delegation
- ✅ **AskUserQuestion()** for user interaction (delegated to agent)
- ❌ No Bash (delegated to agent)

## 🚀 Execution Process

### Step 1: Delegate to Quality Gate Agent

Use Task tool to call the `manager-quality` agent (which has access to issue creation skills):

```yaml
Tool: Task
Parameters:
- subagent_type: "manager-quality"
- description: "Collect and submit user feedback"
- prompt: """You are the manager-quality agent acting as the feedback manager.

**Task**: Collect user feedback and create a GitHub issue.

**Context**:
- Feedback Type: $ARGUMENTS (default to 'issue' if empty)
- Conversation Language: {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE}}

**Instructions**:

1. **Determine Feedback Type**:
   - If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use it.
   - If not, ask user to select type:
     - Bug Report
     - Feature Request
     - Question/Other

2. **Collect Details**:
   - Ask for 'Title' (short summary)
   - Ask for 'Description' (detailed explanation)
   - Ask for 'Priority' (Low/Medium/High)

3. **Create GitHub Issue**:
   - Use `Bash` with GitHub CLI (`gh issue create`) to submit.
   - Add appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, question) via `--label` flag.
   - Format the body with standard templates.

4. **Report Result**:
   - Show the created issue URL.
   - Confirm success to the user.

**Important**:
- Use conversation_language for all user interactions.
- NO EMOJIS in AskUserQuestion options.
