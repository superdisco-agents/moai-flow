## Usage

### Automatic Detection
The skill automatically detects the programming language context based on:
- File extensions (`.py`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, etc.)
- Language-specific keywords and patterns
- Framework and library mentions

### Manual Invocation
```bash
# Get Python expertise
Skill("moai-lang-unified") # with .py files

# Get Go expertise  
Skill("moai-lang-unified") # with .go files

# Cross-language comparison
Skill("moai-lang-unified") # with multiple languages
```

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Quick Reference**: Immediate language patterns and examples
- **Implementation Guide**: In-depth language-specific guidance
- **Cross-Language**: Comparisons, integration, and migration patterns
