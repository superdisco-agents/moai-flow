# Agents Reference - MoAI-ADK Agent Catalog

**Purpose**: Complete reference catalog of MoAI-ADK's 26 specialized agents with `{domain}-{role}` naming convention and 7-tier hierarchy.

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-25
**Version**: 2.0.0

---

## Quick Reference (30 seconds)

Alfred delegates ALL tasks to specialized agents. 26 agents organized in 7 tiers:

**Tier 1**: `workflow-*` (Command Processors) - Always Active
**Tier 2**: `core-*` (Orchestration & Quality) - Auto-triggered
**Tier 3**: `{domain}-*` (Domain Experts) - Lazy-loaded
**Tier 4**: `mcp-*` (MCP Integrators) - Resume-enabled
**Tier 5**: `factory-*` (Factory Agents) - Meta-development
**Tier 6**: `support-*` (Support Services) - On-demand
**Tier 7**: `ai-*` (AI & Specialized) - Specialized tasks

**Agent Selection**:
- Simple (1 file): 1-2 agents sequential
- Medium (3-5 files): 2-3 agents sequential
- Complex (10+ files): 5+ agents parallel/sequential

**All agents use Task() delegation**:
```python
result = Task(subagent_type="code-backend", prompt="...", context={...})
```

## Implementation Guide (5 minutes)

### Naming Convention: `{domain}-{role}`

All MoAI-ADK agents follow consistent naming:

| Domain | Purpose | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `workflow` | Core workflow command processors | workflow-spec, workflow-tdd |
| `core` | Orchestration & quality management | core-planner, core-quality |
| `code` | Code implementation experts | code-backend, code-frontend |
| `data` | Data-related experts | data-database |

| Agent | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `workflow-project` | `/moai:0-project` | Project initialization and setup |
| `workflow-spec` | `/moai:1-plan` | EARS SPEC generation and planning |
| `workflow-tdd` | `/moai:2-run` | TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution |
| `workflow-docs` | `/moai:3-sync` | Documentation generation and synchronization |

**Loading**: Always active (loaded on command invocation)

---

### Tier 2: Orchestration & Quality (Auto-triggered)

Orchestration and quality management agents.

| Agent | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `core-planner` | `/moai:2-run` Phase 1 | SPEC analysis and execution strategy |
| `core-quality` | Post-implementation | TRUST 5 validation |
| `core-git` | Git operations | Branch, commit, and PR management |

**Loading**: Auto-triggered based on workflow phase

---

### Tier 3: Domain Experts (Lazy-loaded)

Domain-specific implementation experts.

| Agent | Domain | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `code-backend` | Backend | Backend architecture and API design |
| `code-frontend` | Frontend | Frontend UI/UX implementation |
| `data-database` | Data | Database schema design and migration |
| `infra-devops` | Infrastructure | DevOps, monitoring, and performance |
| `security-expert` | Security | Security analysis and OWASP validation |
| `design-uiux` | Design | UI/UX, components, and accessibility |

**Loading**: Lazy-loaded based on keyword detection or SPEC requirements

**Trigger Keywords**:
- `code-backend`: "backend", "api", "server", "endpoint"
- `code-frontend`: "frontend", "ui", "component", "page"
- `data-database`: "database", "schema", "migration", "query"
- `infra-devops`: "deploy", "ci/cd", "performance", "monitoring"
- `security-expert`: "security", "auth", "encryption", "owasp"
- `design-uiux`: "design", "ux", "accessibility", "component"

---

### Tier 4: MCP Integrators (Resume-enabled)

External MCP server integrations with context continuity support.

| Agent | MCP Server | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `mcp-context7` | Context7 | Documentation research and API reference |
| `mcp-figma` | Figma | Design system integration |
| `mcp-notion` | Notion | Knowledge base integration |
| `mcp-playwright` | Playwright | Browser automation and E2E testing |
| `mcp-sequential-thinking` | Sequential-Thinking | Complex reasoning and strategic analysis |

**Resume Pattern** (40-60% token savings):
```python
# Initial call
result = Task(subagent_type="mcp-context7", prompt="Research React 19 APIs")
agent_id = result.agent_id

# Resume with context
result2 = Task(subagent_type="mcp-context7", prompt="Compare with React 18", resume=agent_id)
```

**Benefits**:
- Token savings: 40-60% reduction vs. fresh context
- Context accuracy: 95%+ in resumed sessions

| `factory-command` | Custom slash command creation and optimization |

**Use Case**: When developing MoAI-ADK itself (not for end-user projects)

---

### Tier 6: Support (On-demand)

Support and utility services.

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `support-debug` | Error analysis and diagnostic support |
| `support-claude` | Claude Code configuration management |

---

### System Agents

Built-in system agents for codebase exploration.

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Explore` | Codebase exploration and file system analysis |
| `Plan` | Strategic decomposition and planning |

**Note**: These are Claude Code built-in agents, not MoAI-ADK custom agents.

## Advanced Implementation (10+ minutes)

### Agent Selection Criteria

| Task Complexity | Files | Architecture Impact | Agents | Strategy |
|----------------|-------|---------------------|--------|----------|
| Simple | 1 file | No impact | 1-2 agents | Sequential |
| Medium | 3-5 files | Moderate | 2-3 agents | Sequential |
| Complex | 10+ files | High impact | 5+ agents | Mixed parallel/sequential |

**Decision Tree**:
```
Is this a new feature or architecture change?
├─ YES, 10+ files → Complex (5+ agents, parallel/sequential)
├─ YES, 3-5 files → Medium (2-3 agents, sequential)
└─ NO, 1-2 files → Simple (1-2 agents, sequential)
```

---

### Delegation Principles

1. **Agent-First**: Alfred NEVER executes tasks directly. ALWAYS delegates via Task()

2. **Naming Consistency**: All agents follow `{domain}-{role}` pattern
   - Lowercase only
   - Hyphen separator
   - Domain prefix indicates tier

3. **Context Passing**: Pass each agent's results as context to the next agent
   ```python
   result1 = Task("code-backend", "Design API")
   result2 = Task("code-frontend", "Implement UI", context={"api_design": result1})
   ```

4. **Sequential vs Parallel**:
   - Sequential: When dependencies exist between agents
   - Parallel: When agents work independently

---

### Merged Agents (Historical Reference)

The following agents were merged to reduce complexity:

| Old Agent | Merged Into | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| doc-syncer | workflow-docs | Documentation consolidation |
| trust-checker | core-quality | Quality gate unification |
| api-designer | code-backend | Backend expertise consolidation |
| migration-expert | data-database | Data operations unification |
| monitoring-expert | infra-devops | Infrastructure consolidation |
| performance-engineer | infra-devops | Infrastructure consolidation |
| component-designer | design-uiux | Design system unification |
| accessibility-expert | design-uiux | Design system unification |

**Total Agents**: 26 (down from 35, -26% reduction)

---

### Removed Agents

| Agent | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| format-expert | Replaced by direct linter usage (ruff, prettier) |
| sync-manager | Redundant with workflow-docs |

---

### Skill Consolidation Reference

The following legacy skills have been consolidated into unified skills:

| Legacy Skills (Removed) | Unified Skill (Current) | Reason |
|------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| moai-foundation-specs, moai-foundation-ears, moai-foundation-trust, moai-foundation-git, moai-foundation-langs | moai-foundation-core | Core principles consolidation |
| moai-lang-python, moai-lang-typescript, moai-lang-sql | moai-lang-unified | Language unification |
| moai-essentials-debug, moai-essentials-perf, moai-essentials-refactor | moai-toolkit-essentials | Development tools unification |
| moai-cc-claude-md, moai-cc-configuration, moai-cc-hooks, moai-cc-claude-settings | moai-foundation-claude | Claude Code features consolidation |
| moai-domain-backend, moai-domain-frontend | moai-lang-unified | Domain expertise integration |
| moai-domain-database, moai-domain-devops | moai-platform-baas | Infrastructure consolidation |
| moai-domain-security, moai-security-owasp | moai-system-universal | Security consolidation |

| moai-core-context-budget | moai-foundation-context | Token budget management |
| moai-quality-validation | moai-foundation-quality | Quality gate consolidation |

**Note**: All agent_skills_mapping references have been updated to use unified skills. Legacy skill names are no longer valid.

### Tier Loading Strategy

| Tier | Loading | Context Budget | Trigger |
|------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Tier 1 | Always active | 30% | Command invocation |
| Tier 2 | Auto-trigger | 20% | Quality gates, orchestration |
| Tier 3 | Lazy-load | 30% | Keyword detection, SPEC analysis |
| Tier 4 | On-demand | 10% | MCP operations |
| Tier 5 | On-demand | 5% | Meta-generation |
| Tier 6 | On-demand | 3% | Errors, configuration |
| Tier 7 | On-demand | 2% | AI model integration |

**Total Budget**: 100% of available context per workflow phase

---

### Error Handling

**Common Errors**:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Agent not found" | Verify agent name follows `{domain}-{role}` (lowercase, hyphenated) |
| "Agent not responding" | Check agent permissions in settings.json |
| "Context overflow" | Execute /clear and retry with smaller context |
| "Permission denied" | Update IAM rules in .claude/settings.json |

**Error Recovery Pattern**:
```python
try:
    result = Task("code-backend", "Implement feature")
except AgentNotFoundError:
    # Check agent name format
    result = Task("code-backend", "Implement feature")  # Corrected name
except PermissionError:
    # Update settings.json IAM rules
    result = Task("code-backend", "Implement feature", permissions=["write"])
```
