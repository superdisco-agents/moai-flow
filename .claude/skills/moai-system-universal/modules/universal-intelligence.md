## Usage Examples

### Predictive Stack Selection

```python
# Analyze requirements and predict optimal stack
intelligence = UniversalProjectIntelligence()
analysis = await intelligence.analyze_project_requirements(
    requirements=ProjectRequirements(
        type="enterprise-saas",
        scale="large",
        compliance=["SOC2", "GDPR", "SOX"],
        performance_requirements={"latency": "<100ms", "uptime": "99.99%"}
    ),
    constraints=ProjectConstraints(
        budget="$200k/year",
        timeline="6 months",
        team_size=15
    )
)

# AI predicts optimal combination
prediction = analysis.predictions
# Languages: TypeScript (frontend), Python (backend), Go (microservices)
# BaaS: Clerk (auth), Supabase (database), Vercel (deployment)
# Security: OWASP, Zero Trust, Automated compliance
```

### Cross-Domain Optimization

```python
# Optimize across all technology domains
optimizer = UniversalOptimizer()
optimization_plan = await optimizer.create_optimization_plan(
    current_system=CurrentSystemAnalysis(),
    target_metrics=PerformanceTargets(
        response_time_ms=50,
        throughput_rps=10000,
        security_score=95,
        compliance_score=100
    )
)

# Returns comprehensive optimization strategy
# - Language-specific optimizations (async patterns, memory management)
# - Database optimizations (indexing, connection pooling)
# - Infrastructure optimizations (CDN, edge computing)
# - Security optimizations (WAF, rate limiting)
# - Cost optimizations (resource rightsizing, provider switching)
```

### Automated Compliance Mapping

```python
# Map requirements to compliance frameworks
compliance_mapper = ComplianceIntelligence()
compliance_plan = await compliance_mapper.generate_compliance_plan(
    business_requirements=["financial_data", "user_privacy", "audit_trail"],
    target_markets=["US", "EU", "APAC"],
    industry="fintech"
)

# Automatically identifies required frameworks
# - SOX (financial data, US market)
# - GDPR (user privacy, EU market)
# - PCI-DSS (financial transactions)
# - ISO 27001 (international security standard)
```

roadmap = await roadmap_generator.generate_comprehensive_roadmap(
    current_tech_stack=CurrentStack(),
    business_goals=BusinessGoals(
        growth_rate=200,  # 200% growth over 3 years
        international_expansion=True,
        regulatory_changes=["AI regulations", "data privacy laws"]
    ),
    risk_tolerance="medium"
)

# Provides detailed migration plan with:
# - Phase-wise technology upgrades
# - Risk mitigation strategies
# - Resource allocation plans
# - Cost projections and ROI analysis
```

### Cross-Technology Migration Planning

```python
# Plan complex multi-technology migration
migration_planner = CrossTechnologyMigrationPlanner()
migration_plan = await migration_planner.create_migration_plan(
    source_state=LegacySystemAnalysis(),
    target_state=ModernArchitecture(),
    constraints=MigrationConstraints(
        downtime_tolerance="2 hours",
        data_loss_tolerance="0%",
        rollback_capability=True
    )
)

# Generates detailed migration strategy:
# - Data migration with zero downtime
# - API compatibility layers
# - Gradual traffic shifting
# - Automated rollback procedures
