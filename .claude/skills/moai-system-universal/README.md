        scale="large",
        compliance=["SOC2", "GDPR"],
        performance_targets={"latency": "<100ms", "uptime": "99.99%"}
    )
)

# Get AI-powered recommendations
recommendations = analysis.recommendations
print(f"Recommended Stack: {recommendations.technology_stack}")
```

### Complete Development Orchestration

```python
# Initialize Development Orchestrator
